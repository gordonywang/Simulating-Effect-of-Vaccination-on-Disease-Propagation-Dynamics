# Simulating-Effect-of-Vaccination-on-Disease-Propagation-Dynamics
Term Project | 70-462: Uncertainty and Risk Modeling | Spring 2019

•	Built as team of 3 a Monte Carlo simulation model of SIR disease propagation dynamics with @RISK in Excel to assess the effectiveness of different vaccination coverages on mitigating an epidemic’s impact on city of 100,000 people.

•	Synthesized analysis, results, and insights into 12-page report and 13-minute group presentation to 30 students.
